I was born in Rome but I lived in Edmonton for a while. I came back frozen and I took a Master's Degree in Computing Science. I've started working for a gaming company as Software Engineer. I mostly work in back-end systems but my artistic soul likes moving pixels in CSS.
During my days I borrow my time to people and their problems, I'm paid to solve them.
During my days I write words on a screen which are supposed to solve those problems.
During my days I write the bugs I will fight one day.    

Honestly, I feel I'm a *software craftsman*.
