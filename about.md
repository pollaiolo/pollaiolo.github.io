Howdy! The guy in the circle it's me giving a sense of scale to wheat plants. I was born in Rome but I lived in Edmonton for a while. I came back frozen and I took a Master's Degree in Computing Science. I've started working for a gaming company as a Software Engineer. I mostly work on back-end systems but my artistic soul loves to color pixels in CSS.\\
Everyday I lend my time to people and their problems, I'm paid to solve them. I write words on a screen which are supposed to solve those problems. I write the bugs I will fight one day.    

Honestly, I feel I am a *software craftsman*.
