Recently, I had a lecture at the University of Rome3 where I spoke about *Quality through Software Process*. When I started working on this talk I thought that I wouldn't have had the need to present any practical example since the topic was really abstract: *Quality*. I realized, very soon, that nothing could have explained this concept better than **code**. Because the code is the tool we use to give quality to our projects and nothing is more concise and clear than this.\\
I ended up building a fullstack application that you can see in my repository. During the talk I did a couple of live coding sessions where I explained the mistakes I intentionally put in a first version of the app. Then I refactored and committed the *correct* version during the talk. You can take a look at the bad design choices and their solutions by navigating the `GIT` history of the repository.\\
This post will not be about the web application and neither will be a transcription of the talk. What I would like to underline here is how *quality* can be achieved and why we should strive to keep it as high as possible.

Writing code with other people, for its nature, tends to chaos.
