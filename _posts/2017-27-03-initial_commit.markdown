I've started thinking about having a blog long time ago but I've never had the time to begin. Recently, I felt the need of writing something so I've found the time or just the patience to start.\\
My intent is to note down things that I use at work like code snippets, alias, design patterns etc. Those things usually slip away from my memory (256byte of gray matter) and I have to google them over and over again. I will try to don't make this blog a list of commands ready to copy-paste but also writing about topics that arouse my curiosity. At the time of this post I don't know yet if computing science will be the only topic discussed here but hopefully it won't be.

If anyone will read these words I'd like to apoligize if I will make mistakes or I will be inaccurate in future posts.
